🐳 Fun facts 🐳 
- Blue whales are the largest animal ever known to have lived on Earth.
  These magnificent marine mammals rule the oceans at up to 30 m and
  upwards to 200.000 tons. Their tongue alone can weigh as much as an
  elephant. Their hearts as much as an automobile.

- Blue whales live in all the world's oceans, except the Arctic, 
  occasionally swimming in small groups but usually alone or in 
  pairs. They often spend summers feeding in   polar waters and 
  undertake lengthy migrations towards the Equator as winter arrives.
